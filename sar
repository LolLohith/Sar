Thatâ€™s a smart approachâ€”**using overlapping patches improves classification accuracy**, especially at the edges where segmentation can suffer. Since youâ€™re working with **SAR imagery** and a **color map output (like for roads, vegetation, barren land, background, etc.)**, letâ€™s tailor your patching and stitching pipeline to maximize **smooth, artifact-free classification**.

---

## âœ… Goal:

Segment a **large SAR image** into classes (e.g., roads, vegetation, etc.) using **U-Net**, with **overlapping patches** and output a **stitched segmentation map** with a color-coded output (like a `.png` colormap or multi-channel mask).

---

### ðŸ§± 1. Create Overlapping Patches

```python
import numpy as np

def create_overlapping_patches(image, patch_size=256, stride=128):
    patches = []
    coords = []
    h, w = image.shape[:2]

    for i in range(0, h - patch_size + 1, stride):
        for j in range(0, w - patch_size + 1, stride):
            patch = image[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size]
            patches.append(patch)
            coords.append((i, j))

    return np.array(patches), coords
```

* `stride < patch_size` for overlap
* Use `stride = patch_size // 2` (50% overlap) as a good start

---

### ðŸ§  2. Predict on Patches with U-Net

```python
# Assume patches are shaped (N, H, W, C)
def predict_patches(patches, model):
    predictions = []

    for patch in patches:
        pred = model.predict(patch[np.newaxis, ...])  # shape: (1, H, W, num_classes)
        predictions.append(pred[0])  # Remove batch dim

    return np.array(predictions)  # shape: (N, H, W, num_classes)
```

You can batch this for performance with `model.predict(patches_batch)` if memory allows.

---

### ðŸª¡ 3. Stitch Predictions with Averaging (for Overlaps)

```python
def stitch_predictions(preds, coords, full_size, patch_size, stride):
    h, w = full_size
    num_classes = preds.shape[-1]
    full_mask = np.zeros((h, w, num_classes))
    count_matrix = np.zeros((h, w, 1))

    for pred, (i, j) in zip(preds, coords):
        full_mask[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size] += pred
        count_matrix[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size] += 1

    # Avoid divide-by-zero
    full_mask /= np.maximum(count_matrix, 1)

    # Convert to class indices
    final_mask = np.argmax(full_mask, axis=-1)
    return final_mask  # shape: (H, W)
```

---

### ðŸŽ¨ 4. Apply Colormap for Visualization

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap

def apply_colormap(mask, colormap=None):
    # colormap = {0: (0,0,0), 1: (0,255,0), ...}
    if colormap is None:
        # Default to PASCAL-style colormap
        colormap = {
            0: (0, 0, 0),        # background
            1: (0, 255, 0),      # vegetation
            2: (255, 255, 0),    # barren
            3: (255, 0, 0),      # road
        }

    rgb_mask = np.zeros((*mask.shape, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    for class_id, color in colormap.items():
        rgb_mask[mask == class_id] = color

    return rgb_mask
```

1. Load full SAR image
2. Create overlapping patches
3. Predict with U-Net

It sounds like you're working with **large SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images** for tasks like segmentation using a **U-Net** model, and you've reduced these images in size for training or inference. Now, you want to **divide the large images into patches**, process them individually, and then **stitch the results back together** to reconstruct the full-sized output.

Here's a general pipeline you can follow:

---

### ðŸ”§ Step 1: Patch the Large SAR Image

Split the large image into overlapping or non-overlapping patches.

```python
def create_patches(image, patch_size, stride):
    patches = []
    coords = []
    h, w = image.shape[:2]
    
    for i in range(0, h - patch_size + 1, stride):
        for j in range(0, w - patch_size + 1, stride):
            patch = image[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size]
            patches.append(patch)
            coords.append((i, j))
    
    return patches, coords
```

* **`patch_size`**: Size of each square patch (e.g., 256).
* **`stride`**: How much you slide the window (e.g., 128 for overlapping).

---

### ðŸ§  Step 2: Run Inference with U-Net on Patches

Feed each patch to your U-Net model for prediction.

```python
predictions = []
for patch in patches:
    patch_input = preprocess(patch)  # Normalize, resize if needed
    pred = unet_model.predict(patch_input[np.newaxis, ...])
    predictions.append(pred[0])  # Remove batch dimension
```

---

### ðŸª¡ Step 3: Stitch Predictions Back Together

Reconstruct the full mask using the predicted patches and coordinates.

```python
import numpy as np

def stitch_patches(preds, coords, full_size, patch_size, stride):
    full_mask = np.zeros(full_size)
    count_matrix = np.zeros(full_size)

    for pred, (i, j) in zip(preds, coords):
        full_mask[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size] += pred
        count_matrix[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size] += 1

    # Average overlapping regions
    full_mask /= np.maximum(count_matrix, 1)

    return full_mask
```

* **`full_size`** is the shape of your original SAR image.
* The count matrix helps handle overlapping patches by averaging pixel-wise.

---

### ðŸ§ª Optional Tips:

* Use overlapping patches (stride < patch size) to reduce edge artifacts.
* If working with RGB or multi-channel SAR, adjust for `image.shape[:2]` accordingly.
* Consider padding images before patching to make them divisible by patch size.

---

Would you like help adapting this to your specific data format (e.g., `.tif`, `.npy`, etc.) or running the model on GPU batches for speed?


Perfect â€” with **120 GB CPU RAM** and **multi-GPU setup (12 + 48 + 24 GB GPUs)** using **TensorFlow and Keras**, youâ€™re in a **strong position to efficiently handle overlapping patch-based segmentation on large SAR images**.

Letâ€™s structure the workflow to:

* Efficiently **utilize batching** during prediction
* **Handle overlapping patches**
* **Use TensorFlow/Keras properly** with your GPU resources

---

## ðŸš€ Optimized Pipeline for Your Setup (TensorFlow + Keras)

### âœ… Step-by-Step Code Example:

---

### **1. Patch the Large SAR Image**

```python
import numpy as np

def create_overlapping_patches(image, patch_size=256, stride=128):
    patches = []
    coords = []
    h, w = image.shape[:2]

    for i in range(0, h - patch_size + 1, stride):
        for j in range(0, w - patch_size + 1, stride):
            patch = image[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size]
            patches.append(patch)
            coords.append((i, j))

    return np.array(patches), coords
```

---

### **2. Predict in Batches with TensorFlow/Keras**

```python
def predict_patches_tf(patches, model, batch_size=16):
    num_patches = len(patches)
    predictions = []

    for i in range(0, num_patches, batch_size):
        batch = patches[i:i+batch_size]
        batch = batch.astype("float32") / 255.0  # Normalize if needed
        preds = model.predict(batch, verbose=0)
        predictions.extend(preds)

    return np.array(predictions)
```

You can experiment with `batch_size=32` or more depending on available GPU memory per device.

---

### **3. Stitch the Predictions (Soft Average for Overlap)**

```python
def stitch_predictions(preds, coords, image_shape, patch_size=256):
    h, w = image_shape
    num_classes = preds.shape[-1]
    full_mask = np.zeros((h, w, num_classes), dtype=np.float32)
    count_mask = np.zeros((h, w, 1), dtype=np.float32)

    for pred, (i, j) in zip(preds, coords):
        full_mask[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size] += pred
        count_mask[i:i+patch_size, j:j+patch_size] += 1.0

    averaged_mask = full_mask / np.maximum(count_mask, 1e-7)
    final_class_mask = np.argmax(averaged_mask, axis=-1)

    return final_class_mask
```

---

### **4. Apply Color Map**

```python
def apply_colormap(mask, colormap=None):
    if colormap is None:
        colormap = {
            0: (0, 0, 0),        # background
            1: (0, 255, 0),      # vegetation
            2: (255, 255, 0),    # barren
            3: (255, 0, 0),      # road
        }

    rgb_mask = np.zeros((*mask.shape, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
    for class_id, color in colormap.items():
        rgb_mask[mask == class_id] = color

    return rgb_mask
```

---

### âœ… Multi-GPU Usage (Optional Advanced Tip)

If you want to **scale to multiple GPUs**, wrap your model like this:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model("your_model_path")  # Or create here
```

TensorFlow will automatically split batches across GPUs.

---

### ðŸ’¡ Tips:

* For very large images: load patches in batches from disk to avoid huge RAM usage.
* If your SAR image size is not divisible by the patch size, **pad** it before splitting, then crop the result afterward.
* Save final color-mapped mask as PNG:

```python
from PIL import Image
Image.fromarray(rgb_mask).save("final_segmentation.png")
```

---

### ðŸš§ Optional Add-ons

* Use `tqdm` for progress bars on patching/inference
* Apply **post-processing (e.g., median filtering, CRF)** for smoother masks
* Consider building a **TF Dataset** pipeline if training on large patches
